Front-End Interview Exercises

## First, Do This

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed on your computer.

2. Run `yarn` to install all the dependencies.

3. Run `yarn start` to open the interview exercises in a new browser window.

### Checkers

You are given a React app that renders a Checkers board.

Modify the existing code by implementing these user requirements, to create a functional Checkers game. (The app's main React component is exported [here](https://github.com/Intelight/front-end-interview/blob/master/stories/Checkers.stories.js#L10).)

1. Add the ability for a user to move a piece to any space on the board. (The "movement" interaction can be with simple mouse clicks, drag-n-drop if you're up for a challenge, or even the keyboard if you wish.)

2. Add the ability for a user to move a piece into _a valid space on the board_. (A "valid" space is one where a piece may be moved legally according to the rules of Checkers. See [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Checkers) for reference.)

3. Add the ability to end one player's turn and begin the other's or end the game.
